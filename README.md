Creating interactive visualizations with Python.

Example
---------

Let's make an interactive visualization of a scatter plot. Here we'll have three inputs that can be controlled by the user:

* The plot's title
* What variable goes on the y axis
* Whether we add a smoothing curve to the data

Start by importing a few packages. Gleam uses the [wtforms](http://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) package to provide form inputs. You can use any Python graphing package you want with Gleam, such as [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), but we recommend the intuitive [ggplot](https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/).

    from wtforms import fields
    from ggplot import *

Then import what you'll need from the gleam package:

    from gleam import Page, panels

### Inputs

An `Inputs` panel lets you specify the inputs that the user can control. Here, we add a string input for the title, a multiple choice select field for the Y-axis variable, and a checkbox for the smoother:

    class ScatterInput(panels.Inputs):
        title = fields.StringField(label="Title of plot:")
        yvar = fields.SelectField(label="Y axis",
                                  choices=[("beef", "Beef"),
                                           ("pork", "Pork")])
        smoother = fields.BooleanField(label="Smoothing Curve")

### Output

The output is where your actual plotting goes. It comes in the form of a `plot` method, which takes an argument `inputs` containing the inputs from above. Here we use ggplot to make the plot, taking the arguments into consideration. (You could use *any* Python graphing packages in this function- the sky's the limit, as long as it creates a plot).

    class ScatterPlot(panels.Plot):
        name = "Scatter"

        def plot(self, inputs):
            p = ggplot(meat, aes(x='date', y=inputs.yvar))
            if inputs.smoother:
                p = p + stat_smooth(color="blue")
            p = p + geom_point() + ggtitle(inputs.title)
            return p

### Tying it together in a Page

Constructing an HTML page to allow this control is as simple as combining the input and the output:

    class ScatterPage(Page):
        input = ScatterInput()
        output = ScatterPlot()

### Run the app

You can then run the app with:

     ScatterPage.run()

By default, it will create a local server hosted at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/): you can visit it there to see your cool visualization, which will look something like this:

![plot](http://i.imgur.com/aiEmxbw.png?1)

Try changing the title, the Y axis selector, or try checking the box: you'll see the plot react in real time.

You can add more inputs to the ScatterInput class, and then use them to further customize the plot in the ScatterPlot class.

*Enjoy!*
